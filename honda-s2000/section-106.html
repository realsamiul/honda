<div class="double-h2 _2-col"><h2 id="w-node-_03f0c9af-f77f-ab2b-6927-cb296752ecc9-ce3ef3d5">Every line and curve of the S2000 was sculpted for both performance and beauty. The long hood, short deck, and cockpit-forward stance create a silhouette that’s as functional as it is elegant.</h2><h2 id="w-node-f98c6ba9-b88c-f2d8-387d-fc01d288e69f-ce3ef3d5">Inside, the minimalist interior puts the driver front and center, with controls designed for intuitive use. The S2000’s design is a perfect balance of form and function, built to enhance the connection between car and driver.</h2></div></div></div>
